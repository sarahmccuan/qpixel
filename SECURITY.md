# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

While this project is under development (i.e. until release 1.0.0), **only the current version is supported**. If you
believe you have found a security vulnerability, ensure you are running the latest commit from GitHub; if you're not,
update to it &mdash; if you are, please report the vulnerability to us.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please [report a security issue](https://codidact.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/1/create/17) via our
support portal. You will receive an automated confirmation that we have received your report, and we'll aim to make an
initial assessment and get back to you within 24 hours. This timeframe is not a guarantee, and some cases may take longer.

In all cases, please *do not* disclose any details of any security issue, potential or confirmed, until we have confirmed
to you that it has been either fixed or confirmed not a vulnerability.

## Bug Bounty & Acknowledgements
There is no bug bounty program available for this software at present. If you wish us to make an acknowledgement of your
contribution, please let us know under what name you'd like it to be added, and to what URL you would like us to link.
